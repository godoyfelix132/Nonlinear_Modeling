  abstract={A MESFET model is presented that is suitable for use in conventional, time-domain circuit simulation programs. The parameters of the model are evaluated either from experimental data or from more detailed device analysis. The model is shown to be more complete than earlier models, which neglect transit-time and other effects. An integrated circuit (IC) design example is discussed.},
