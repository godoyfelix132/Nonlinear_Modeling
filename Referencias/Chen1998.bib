  abstract={We have developed a new empirical model to represent the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of HEMT devices. This model is simple and yet capable of representing the HEMT I-V characteristics with high accuracy. Excellent modeling of the measured drain current, its first (transconductance), second, and third derivatives with respect to gate voltage for multiple drain biases is demonstrated. A simple model extraction procedure has been developed and is described in the letter.},
