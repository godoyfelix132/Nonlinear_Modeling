abstract = {Abstract This article presents an improved nonlinear IDS(VGS, VDS) model useful for modeling the experimental pulsed I-V measurement data of GaN FETs operated at large drain-source voltages. This improved IDS(VGS, VDS) model is based on the Chalmers model. The main features of the improved nonlinear IDS(VGS, VDS) model are the two analytical expressions that are incorporated to model the output conductance and the saturation voltage. The new model only requires 13 parameters easily determined from experimental pulsed I-V data. Comparison between simulated and measured data of an inverse class F PA designed with a commercial GaN FET at 1.5 GHz demonstrate that the proposed model is suitable for microwave circuit design based on GaN transistors. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
