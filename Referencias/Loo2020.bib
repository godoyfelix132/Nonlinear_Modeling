abstract = {Abstract This article presents an improved nonlinear empirical I/V model suitable for GaAs and GaN FETs. The new drain-to-source current formulation accurately represents the symmetric and the asymmetric bell-shaped transconductance (gm) for all VDS values. Besides modeling with high accuracy the I/V characteristic, the proposed model can fit the first and second derivatives of the transconductance, from the ohmic to the saturation region, including the pinch-off region. The high correlation between experimental and simulated data of the I/V curves of GaAs and GaN FETs, ACPR, load-pull, and a class-J power amplifier designed in S-band corroborates the usefulness of the proposed model, considering only the static I/V model as the main nonlinear element of the electrical equivalent circuit model of the transistor.},
